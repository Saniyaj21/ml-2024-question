### Group — B
(Short Answer Type Questions)

2. **What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Provide examples.**

   **Answer:**
   - **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is for the model to learn to predict the output from the input data. Examples include classification tasks like spam detection in emails and regression tasks like predicting house prices.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on data without labels. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points. Examples include clustering tasks like grouping customers based on purchasing behavior and dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

3. **Explain the concept of overfitting and underfitting with examples.**

   **Answer:**
   - **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns not only the underlying pattern but also the noise in the training data. This leads to excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new data. Example: A decision tree with too many branches might fit the training data perfectly but fail on unseen data.
   - **Underfitting**: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and new data. Example: A linear regression model might underfit a dataset with a complex non-linear relationship.

4. **How to handle categorical data in machine learning? Provide code examples in Python.**

   **Answer:**
   Categorical data can be handled using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder

   # Example dataset
   data = {'color': ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'blue']}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   # One-Hot Encoding
   one_hot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
   one_hot_encoded = one_hot_encoder.fit_transform(df[['color']])
   print("One-Hot Encoded Data:\n", one_hot_encoded)

   # Label Encoding
   label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
   label_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['color'])
   print("Label Encoded Data:\n", label_encoded)
   ```

5. **Describe the steps to install Anaconda and set up a Python environment for machine learning.**

   **Answer:**
   1. **Download Anaconda**: Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the installer for your operating system.
   2. **Install Anaconda**: Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   3. **Create a New Environment**:
      ```bash
      conda create -n myenv python=3.8
      ```
   4. **Activate the Environment**:
      ```bash
      conda activate myenv
      ```
   5. **Install Required Packages**:
      ```bash
      conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
      ```
   6. **Install JupyterLab**:
      ```bash
      conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
      ```

6. **Explain the significance of the confusion matrix in evaluating the performance of a classification model.**

   **Answer:**
   The confusion matrix is a table that is used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). This allows for the calculation of various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix provides a more detailed insight into the performance of a model beyond simple accuracy.

7. **Describe the decision tree algorithm with an example. Provide Python code to implement a decision tree classifier.**

   **Answer:**
   Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features, making decisions at each node and branching out to leaves.

   Example: Predicting whether a person buys a car based on their age and salary.

   ```python
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

   # Load dataset
   iris = load_iris()
   X, y = iris.data, iris.target

   # Split data
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

   # Create and train the model
   clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
   clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Predict and evaluate
   y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
   print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
   ```

8. **Explain the K-Means clustering algorithm. Illustrate with an example and provide Python code for clustering a dataset.**

   **Answer:**
   K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering. It partitions the data into K clusters, with each data point assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean.

   Example: Clustering a simple dataset into 3 clusters.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

   # Example dataset
   X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
                 [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])

   # Apply K-Means
   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=0).fit(X)
   y_kmeans = kmeans.predict(X)

   # Plotting the clusters
   plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, s=50, cmap='viridis')
   centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
   plt.scatter(centers[:, 0], centers[:, 1], c='red', s=200, alpha=0.75)
   plt.show()
   ```

9. **Discuss the concept of cross-validation in machine learning. Why is it important? Provide Python code to perform cross-validation.**

   **Answer:**
   Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into training and validation sets multiple times. It helps in assessing how the model generalizes to an independent dataset and in selecting the best model parameters.

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
   from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

   # Load dataset
   iris = load_iris()
   X, y = iris.data, iris.target

   # Create the model
   clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()

   # Perform cross-validation
   scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)
   print("Cross-validation scores:", scores)
   print("Mean accuracy:", scores.mean())
   ```

10. **What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)? Describe its architecture and use it for image classification with a Python example.**

    **Answer:**
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model primarily used for analyzing visual data. It consists of layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. CNNs are used for tasks like image classification and object detection.

    Example: Image classification using a simple CNN.

    ```python
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Load dataset
    (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()

    # Normalize data
    train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

    # Define the model
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation
